//Given an array A of N elements. Find the majority element in the array.
//A majority element in an array A of size N is an element that appears more than N/2 times in the array

// Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm => Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)


//Moore's Voting Alorithm
//The logic is that, if there is a value as majority element, the count of that value in this code will never become zero.
//Because the number of values other than the answer will always be less, so it can never outnumber the count of the answer value, if there is an answer.
