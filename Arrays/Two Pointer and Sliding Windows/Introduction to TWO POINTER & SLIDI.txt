Introduction to TWO POINTER & SLIDIN WINDOW

1.Its a method not an algorithm.
2.There is mainly 4 patters in it.
    a) constant window.
	example like finding the largest sum of k consecutive      elemensts from a array.
    b) Longest SubArray / Substring with condition *****
        *Three approach: bruteforce, better, optimal.
	*in sliding window there are shrinking and expanding happends to 'r' and shrink happends to 'l'.
   
    c)No of subarrays with some condition(*******)
	
	*In these kind of questions we use the logic the pattern 2. 
	*If the question is to find the no of subarrays with sum = k.First we will find the no of subarrays with sum <= k and then we will find the no of sub array with sum <= k-1. Then we subtract the two values to get the required answer.

    d)Shortest or Minimum Window, with a condition.





Note:
This is not a constant method, its a constructive method which changes according to the problem. But the two pointer and sliding of window stays the same.
